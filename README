Rasdascreen (C) Uto 2016
This software is open source, and is licensed under the GPL v3 or above license 

REQUIREMENTS:

- This software requires python interpreter, please refer to Python documentation to find how to install for your OS. 
- The Python script has been created using Python 2.7, there is a chance that it doesn't work on older or newer versions.

USAGE:

1) Create a 128x96 image, with 16 colors (4 bpp), save it as uncompressed BMP file (make sure you save it as 16 colors BMP file). Save it where you uncompressed radascreen
2) Run:  python radascreen.py <bmp name> <tap name>. i.e.: python radascreen.py strawberryfields.bmp strawberryfields.tap

Common issues:

- The converter says file size is incorrect: Make sure you saved the BMP file as uncompressed, 16 colors (4bpp) and your image size is 128x96.

- Everything goes fine, but the picture doesn't show, I only see garbage on screen: First of all, make sure you are trying this on a ZX-Uno, Radastanian mode is only avaliable in that computer. if you are using a ZX-Uno, try to enter this just after booting:


OUT 48955,64 
OUT 65339,3

If ater the second OUT you see the "OK" message, then there is a chance what is told in this thread has happend:

What you need to do then is find the new way to activate the radastanian mode, and then:

1) Modify the "LOADER.BAS" file to change radastanian mode activation.
2) Download BAS2TAP and install
3) Edit the BUILD.TAP file to point BAS2TAP call to where your BAS2TAP executable is.
4) Run BUILD.TAP to obtain a new radascreen.tap properly patched
